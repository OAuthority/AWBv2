## SAWE
**Semi Automatic Wiki Editor (SAWE)** is, as the name suggests, a semi-automated editor for MediaWiki wiki's to be used to perform mundane, repeat tasks. 
The concept is based on Auto Wiki Browser, however, has diverged much from the initial idea, and no longer strives to maintain 1-1 functionality with AWB; it is instead being built 
from the ground-up using AWB as an example. Functionality seen in AWB is not guranteed to be present in SAWE; however, the goal is to provide coverage of all of the basic functionalities of AWB.

SAWE is being built on .NET Core (.NET 8) and AvaloniaUI to allow it to be cross-platform; it is primarily being developed on macOS, supporting both Windows and Linux also.

> Note: this repository is not production ready and is a proof-of-concept; it may never graduate to being production ready. 

### Contributing 
SAWE is free and open source software, and contributions are welcome if you feel so inclined. Development is primarily done in JetBrains Rider.

### Licensing
This program is free software, and licensed under the GPLv3; it takes inspiration from the original AWB.
This project would not have been possible without the work of the original authors. The original repository can be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/autowikibrowser/code/HEAD/tree/AWB/AWB/).
